# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard app specifically built to be the closest possible CSS to the example markup. Once the assignment is graded, I plan to rebuild the app to my own front end style for my portfolio.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Tasks Completed

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Usage

Once deployed, the application can be viewed in a traditional desktop web browser. It is also optimized for laptop, tablet, and smartphone.
